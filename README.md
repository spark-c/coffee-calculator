# Coffee-Calculator

This is a small calculator app to aid with calculations for (Hario V60) pour-over coffee recipes.

Select a target calculation to make by clicking one of the "select" buttons on the page ("Standard" by default).

The "Standard" calculation requires a Brew Ratio (g of dry coffee / L of water) and desired volume of coffee to brew (Brewed Coffee),
and will output the required volume of water (mL) and mass of dry coffee (g) needed for the brew.

The "Iced Coffee?" checkbox will break down any water calculations into the appropriate amount of water (mL, used to brew) and ice (g, not used in brewing).
